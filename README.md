# Francesco Bonizzi

Hi, I'm Francesco - an italian full stack developer. I really love programming.

I also love putting a profile image in reverse 🙃 (except for the serious profiles...) because I really don't like profile images. *They are all fakes.* So, I faked mine with rotation. If you want you can rotate the screen 🤣

How I work
---
My favourite language is **C#** and whenever I find a solution for something difficult, I push it to a new public repository to share my knowledge. I have a particular proficiency with .NET platform and MSSQL Server. I try to fill my need for knowledge in every project I work on: in my free time I contribute to open source and make videogames. Also, I'm checklists maniac ✔
