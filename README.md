Hi! I'm Francesco Bonizzi, an italian developer. I really love programming.

I also love putting a profile image in reverse (except for the serious profiles...) because I really don't like profile images. *They are all fakes.* So, I faked mine with rotation. If you want you can rotate the screen ðŸ¤£

For example here I was watching the ground from the sky.

My favourite language is **C#** and whenever I find a solution for something difficult, I push it to a new public repository to share my knowledge. If you can improve my little repos, you are welcome!

Iâ€™m currently working on **Mark in DeDark**, my last game. *You are lost in a dark castle with only a candle...*

These are the icons of my other games, aren't them pretty? You can find their code in my repos!
