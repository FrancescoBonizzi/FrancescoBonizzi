Hi! I'm Francesco Bonizzi and I love programming.

I also love putting a profile image in reverse because I really don't like profile images. They are all fakes. So, I faked mine with rotation. If you want you can rotate the screen ðŸ¤£

My favourite language is C# and whenever I find a solution for something difficult, I push it to a new public repository to share my knowledge. If you can improve my little repos, you are welcome!
