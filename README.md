# Francesco Bonizzi

Hi, I'm Francesco - an italian full stack developer. I really love programming.

I also love putting a profile image in reverse (except for the serious profiles...) because I really don't like profile images. *They are all fakes.* So, I faked mine with rotation. If you want you can rotate the screen ðŸ¤£

How I work

My favourite language is **C#** and whenever I find a solution for something difficult, I push it to a new public repository to share my knowledge. If you can improve my little repos, you are welcome!
