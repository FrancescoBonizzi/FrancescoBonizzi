My name is Francesco Bonizzi, I'm a **freelance** .NET and Android developer from Parma: my business is called **Imagine Software**.

As a full stack software developer I deal with both front-end and back-end. I prefer the Microsoft stack: .NET Core, ASP .NET Core, but also WPF for desktop applications, and I have a particular proficiency with SQL Server and Azure.

The code I write is clean, uncluttered, easily understandable, consistent and linear. I pay a lot of attention to performance - I come from the world of betting - and to the debuggability of what I develop.

I can be part of your team also with Agile/Scrum method, I can develop modules of code or entire projects. I can also help you with refactoring or with writing Unit Tests and Integration Tests. I will for sure integrate meaningfully with colleagues wherever they are.

I also develop native Kotlin Android apps.
